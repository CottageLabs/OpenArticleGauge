        <p>The transcription factor ELF5 is responsible for gene expression patterning underlying molecular subtypes of breast cancer and may mediate acquired resistance to anti-estrogen therapy.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>We have previously shown that during pregnancy the E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factor ELF5 directs the differentiation of mammary progenitor cells toward the estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and milk producing cell lineage, raising the possibility that ELF5 may suppress the estrogen sensitivity of breast cancers. To test this we constructed inducible models of <italic>ELF5</italic> expression in ER positive luminal breast cancer cells and interrogated them using transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation of DNA followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq). ELF5 suppressed ER and FOXA1 expression and broadly suppressed ER-driven patterns of gene expression including sets of genes distinguishing the luminal molecular subtype. Direct transcriptional targets of ELF5, which included <italic>FOXA1</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, and <italic>MYC</italic>, accurately classified a large cohort of breast cancers into their intrinsic molecular subtypes, predicted ER status with high precision, and defined groups with differential prognosis. Knockdown of ELF5 in basal breast cancer cell lines suppressed basal patterns of gene expression and produced a shift in molecular subtype toward the claudin-low and normal-like groups. Luminal breast cancer cells that acquired resistance to the antiestrogen Tamoxifen showed greatly elevated levels of ELF5 and its transcriptional signature, and became dependent on ELF5 for proliferation, compared to the parental cells. Thus ELF5 provides a key transcriptional determinant of breast cancer molecular subtype by suppression of estrogen sensitivity in luminal breast cancer cells and promotion of basal characteristics in basal breast cancer cells, an action that may be utilised to acquire antiestrogen resistance.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The molecular subtypes of breast cancer are distinguished by their intrinsic patterns of gene expression and can be used to group patients with different prognoses and treatment options. Although molecular subtyping tests are currently under evaluation, some of them are already in use to better tailor therapy for patients; however, the molecular events that are responsible for these different patterns of gene expression in breast cancer are largely undefined. The elucidation of their mechanistic basis would improve our understanding of the disease process and enhance the chances of developing better predictive and prognostic markers, new therapies, and interventions to overcome resistance to existing therapies. Here, we show that the transcription factor ELF5 is responsible for much of the patterning of gene expression that distinguishes the breast cancer subtypes. Additionally, our data suggest that ELF5 may also be involved in the development of resistance to therapies designed to stop estrogen stimulation of breast cancer. These effects of ELF5 appear to represent a partial carryover into breast cancer of its normal role in the mammary gland, where it is responsible for the development of milk-producing structures during pregnancy.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The molecular subtypes of breast cancer are distinguished by their intrinsic patterns of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Perou1">[1]</xref> that have been refined to become prognostic tests under evaluation or in use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Andre1">[2]</xref>. Improving our understanding of the molecular events specifying these subtypes offers the hope of new predictive and prognostic markers, development of new therapies, and interventions to overcome resistance to existing therapies. The estrogen receptor (ER)positive luminal subtypes are characterized by patterns of gene expression driven by the combined direct and indirect transcriptional influences of ER and FOXA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Hurtado1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>ELF5, also known as ESE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Lee1">[4]</xref> is a member of the epithelium specific (ESE) subgroup of the large E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factor family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-GutierrezHartmann1">[5]</xref>, found in lung, placenta, kidney, and most prominently in the breast especially during pregnancy and lactation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Oettgen1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Lapinskas1">[8]</xref>. Placentation fails in <italic>Elf5</italic> knockout mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Donnison1">[9]</xref> because de novo production of ELF5 acts with CDX2 and EOMES to specify and maintain commitment to the trophoblast cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Hemberger1">[10]</xref>. The early embryo continues to repress <italic>Elf5</italic> expression in association with promoter methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Ng1">[11]</xref>. In the developing mammary epithelium <italic>Elf5</italic> is re-expressed in a mutually exclusive pattern with ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Oakes1">[12]</xref>. <italic>Elf5</italic>−/− mice produced via tetraploid embryonic stem cell rescue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Oakes1">[12]</xref> or conditional knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Choi1">[13]</xref> showed complete failure of mammary alveolargenesis, a developmental stage driven by prolactin and progesterone. These hormones induce <italic>Elf5</italic> expression and re-expression of <italic>Elf5</italic> in prolactin receptor knockout mammary epithelium rescued alveolargenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Harris1">[14]</xref>. Forced <italic>ELF5</italic> expression in nulliparous mouse mammary gland produced precocious mammary epithelial cell differentiation and milk protein production. This was associated with erosion of the mammary CD61+ progenitor cell population, and conversely, <italic>Elf5</italic> knockout caused accumulation of this population, establishing ELF5 as a key regulator of cell fate decisions made by this progenitor cell population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Oakes1">[12]</xref> and explaining the developmental effects described above.</p>
      <p>The CD61+ progenitor cell is the cell of origin for basal breast cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Lim1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Molyneux1">[16]</xref> and <italic>Elf5</italic> is expressed predominantly by the ER− progenitor subset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Kendrick1">[17]</xref>, suggesting, together with the developmental effects of Elf5 outlined above, a role for ELF5 in determining aspects of molecular subtype of breast cancer. To examine this hypothesis we manipulated the expression of ELF5 in basal and luminal breast cancer cell lines and examined the phenotypic consequences.</p>

        <title>Identification of ELF5 DNA Binding Sites by ChIP-Seq</title>
        <p>We used a mixture of antibodies against V5 and ELF5 to immunoprecipitate DNA bound by ELF5-V5 in T47D cells, which we then sequenced, allowing us to map the ELF5-bound regions of the human genome and to identify the direct transcriptional targets of ELF5. Intersection of MACS and SWEMBL peak calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Schmidt1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Zhang1">[26]</xref> identified 1,763 common sites of ELF5 interaction in the genome at 48 h. Data are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s018">Table S1</xref> or via GEO (GSE30407). DNA binding was much higher at 48 h than 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with the observed changes in gene expression by Affymetrix arrays. Combination of the Affymetrix expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation of DNA followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data showed that ELF5 binding within 10 kb of a transcription start site (TSS) changed the expression level of that gene to a much greater extent than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), demonstrating that ELF5 has consistent transcriptional activity via association with DNA within this range. ELF5 bound mostly to distal intragenic regions of the genome (50%) and to introns within genes (25%), but also at high frequency to promoter regions (20%) mostly within 1 kb of a TSS (18%). Downstream (Dstr) sites were seldom used. The 5′ UTR was also a frequent target of ELF5 but the 3′ UTR was infrequently targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Transcription factor motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) contained within the DNA fragments precipitated by ELF5 were predominantly ELF5 and other ETS factor motifs; however, we also observed enrichment of sites for Stat1 and Stat3, which contain a TTCC core ets motif. We also observed very significant enrichment of sites for the <italic>FOXA1</italic> and <italic>NKX3-2</italic> transcription factors. The binding of ELF5 to the <italic>FOXA1</italic> promoter region is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3E</xref>. We validated the indicated peak on the <italic>FOXA1</italic> promoter, and three other target transcription factors by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). <italic>FOXA1</italic>, <italic>RUNX1</italic>, <italic>GATA3</italic>, and <italic>MEIS2</italic> were validated as targets of ELF5 by comparison to input, indicating that ELF5 heads a transcriptional cascade. We searched for curated functional signatures among the ChIP targets using GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Many of the functional signatures observed in the ChIP data were also present in the expression data, demonstrating a direct transcriptional action of ELF5 to exert these regulatory effects.</p>

        <p>Knockdown of ELF5 expression by more than 80% had a small effect on total cell accumulation in T47D or MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s012">Figure S12D</xref>). We knocked down ELF5 in two basal breast cancer cell lines and observed a significant and sustained reduction in cell accumulation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>), which was not seen in luminal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s012">Figure S12D</xref>). This observation clearly demonstrates a subtype-specific role of ELF5 in breast cancer cells.</p>
        <p>Cells can fail to accumulate in culture via two main mechanisms, by reduced rates of cell division or by the loss of cells through detachment and apoptosis. We investigated these possibilities.</p>
        <p>We examined cell proliferation. Labeling of cells with BrdU and propidium iodide showed that induction of ELF5-V5 caused repartitioning of cells from S-phase into gap 1 of the cell cycle (G1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s013">Figure S13A</xref>). Western blotting showed a loss of phosphorylated forms of the pocket proteins, p130, p107, and Rb, accompanied by loss of cyclin proteins A2, B1, and D1, and accumulation of the inhibitor p21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s013">Figure S13B</xref>). Many of these changes also occurred at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s013">Figure S13C</xref>), indicating a transcriptional basis to these changes that together suggest inhibition of proliferation by G1 arrest. To test this we arrested T47D-ELF5-V5 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle using hydroxyurea (HU) and then released them, by HU wash out, into cycle in the presence and absence of induction of ELF5-V5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, corresponding flow cytometric plots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s013">Figure S13D</xref>, and Western blot quantification in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s013">Figure S13E</xref>). Induction of ELF5-V5 reduced the percentage of cells exiting G1 into S-phase and was associated with a reduced accumulation of cyclin D1 protein and reduction in the expression of cyclin B1, demonstrating that ELF5-V5 expressing cells failed to re-enter the cell cycle from G1.</p>
        <p>We previously formed a set of 641 genes associated with cell cycle control by a combination of genes from cell cycle–related GO ontologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Alles1">[27]</xref>. This set very significantly overlapped with 125 genes repressed, and 42 genes induced, by <italic>ELF5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14A</xref>), and of these 55 were ELF5 ChIP targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14B</xref> heat maps) indicating a direct transcriptional influence of ELF5 on proliferation. Upregulated ELF5 ChIP targets were characterized by the presence of tumor suppressor genes while downregulated genes were enriched in genes controlling cell proliferation. Upregulated genes included RB1CC1 (promotes RB1 expression), TBRG1 (promotes G1 arrest via CDKN2A), IRF1 (initiates interferon response), COPS2 (p53 stabilizer), CHFR (prevents passage into mitosis), DAB2 (lost in ovarian cancer), and RAD50 (DNA damage checkpoint). Also in this group are DDIT3 (promotes apoptosis due to endoplasmic reticulum stress) and ERBB2IP (disrupts RAF/RAS signaling). ELF5 ChIP targets repressed by elevated ELF5 were characterized by genes required for mitosis, such as GTSE1 (microtubule rearrangement), KIF11 (spindle formation), FBXO3 (anaphase promoting complex), KNTC1 (mitotic check point), PPP1CC (PTW/PP1 complex member), and PMF1 (MIS12 complex chromosome alignment). Other proproliferative ELF5 ChIP targets that were downregulated include EGFR and IGF1R (potent mammary mitogen receptors), MAPK13 (downstream signaling molecule), c-MYC (key regulator of proliferation), KLF10 (transcriptional repressor of proliferation), and NME1 and SLC29A2 (required for nucleotide synthesis). This 55-gene signature is significantly enriched in many breast cancer series (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14C</xref>) and showed differential expression between ER+ and ER− cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14B</xref>, right-hand heat map). Interestingly the mitogenic genes that are repressed by forced ELF5 expression in ER+ T47D cells are generally highly expressed in ER− cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14B</xref>), showing again that ELF5 has a subtype-dependent role in cell proliferation and may contribute to the proliferative drive in ER− cancers.</p>
        <p>A large number of detached and floating cells were observed in cultures after 48 h of DOX treatment and became most prominent by 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Replating efficiency was greatly reduced, indicating that new adherence proteins could not be rapidly synthesized and deployed following their destruction with trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Higher rates of apoptosis, measured using flow cytometry, were observed in T47D-ELF5-V5 and MCF7-ELF5-V5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The levels of beta 1-integrin were much lower by 72 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g005">Figure 5D</xref> quantitated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s012">Figure S12E and S12</xref>F). Its signaling partner integrin-linked kinase (ILK) also showed reduced expression. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) levels also fell slightly but phosphorylation of FAK was much reduced from 5 d, as was SRC kinase expression and especially phosphorylation, indicating reduced signal transduction in response to the lower levels of beta1-integrin and detection of the extracellular matrix. Together these results implicate loss of extracellular integrins in the detachment of cells in response to forced ELF5 expression.</p>

        <title>ELF5 Modulates Estrogen Action</title>
        <p>Among the direct transcriptional targets of ELF5 are a number with established roles in proliferation in response to estrogen, such as <italic>FOXA1</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>CDK6</italic>, <italic>FGFR1</italic>, and <italic>IGF1R</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s018">Table S1</xref>).

Western blotting showed that induction of ELF5-V5 expression caused falls in the levels of ER, the estrogen-induced gene progesterone receptor (PGR), pioneer factor FOXA1, and progenitor cell-regulator GATA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The activities of ER and FOXA1 transcriptional reporters (ERE and UGT2B17, respectively) also fell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), demonstrating that forced ELF5 expression suppressed estrogen sensitivity. These cell lines are dependent on estrogen for proliferation, raising the possibility that forced ELF5 expression inhibited proliferation simply by reducing ER expression. We tested this possibility by forced re-expression of ER and treatment with estrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), but we did not observe any relief of the inhibition of proliferation caused by forced ELF5 expression.</p>

        <p>We further examined the effects of induction of ELF5 on estrogen-driven gene expression by intersecting our ELF5-regulated genes with a previously defined set of estrogen-regulated genes in MCF7 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Alles1">[27]</xref>. Among a set of 477 genes showing estrogen-induced expression in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, “E2 induced”), 115 showed loss of expression in response to ELF5-V5, an overlap with a highly significant <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic> = 5E−84) and odds ratio (OR = 16). These genes (heat map in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14D</xref>, “E2I”), contained signatures for cell cycle control and DNA replication gene sets. Furthermore when we focused on 71 estrogen-induced genes previously defined as involved in proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Alles1">[27]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, “E2 Prolif”), we observed the same very significant enrichment (<italic>p</italic> = 2E−32), confirming the action of ELF5 to repress the expression of estrogen-induced genes involved in proliferation. The effect of ELF5 expression on 289 estrogen-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, “E2 repressed” and heat map <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14D</xref>, “E2R”) was much less pronounced. Thus the predominant effect of forced ELF5 expression was suppression of estrogen-induced gene expression. Just 29 genes were direct transcriptional targets of both ELF5 and ER, a small fraction of the total number of genes showing changed expression, indicating that the actions of ELF5 and ER are largely executed by intermediaries, rather than direct action of ELF5 and ER at the same genomic locus.</p>
        <p>We used hypergeometric enrichment to discover previously defined experimental signatures among the direct transcriptional targets of ELF5. Signatures indicative of estrogen action were prominent among ELF5 ChIP targets downregulated (fold change [FC]&gt;1.5 and false discover rate [FDR]&gt;0.25) by <italic>ELF5</italic> expression, including sets of genes that were ESR1 targets, involved in endocrine resistance or which distinguished the luminal from basal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Among the cancer-focused sets provided by Oncomine (set names in lower case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) were many associated with distinction of the triple negative and ER/PR/HER2-positive subtypes. Sets among the upregulated ChIP targets included metastasis, apoptosis, and high grade. Heat maps illustrating the changed expression of the individual ELF5 ChIP targets are shown using the top-hit breast cancer series (* marked sets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6E</xref> shown as heat maps in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14E</xref>). This investigation again illustrates the repression of estrogen action by induction of ELF5, but indicates that many of the poorer prognostic aspects of the ER− subtypes may be due to ELF5-induced genes. Again ELF5 appears to have subtype-specific actions.</p>

        <title>ELF5 Specifies Breast Cancer Subtype</title>
        <p>We examined the ability of the direct transcriptional targets of ELF5 to predict aspects of breast cancer phenotype. A set of 164 genes was defined as ChIP targets with altered expression in response to induction of ELF5 in T47D cells. This gene set accurately predicted ER status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s015">Figure S15A</xref>) in the Reyal breast cancer series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Reyal1">[28]</xref>. The Confusion Matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s015">Figure S15B</xref>) shows that the direct transcriptional targets of ELF5 accurately predicted intrinsic subtype, with nearly 100% of the luminal/basal distinctions correctly identified. Clustering of the NKI-295 set <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-vandeVijver1">[29]</xref>, using the direct transcriptional targets of ELF5, distinguished the intrinsic subtypes and produced a clear separation of tumor characteristics such as poor prognosis, early metastasis, early death, recurrence, survival, grade, mutation status, and marker expression, such as ER and PR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s015">Figure S15C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We assessed the ability of <italic>ELF5</italic> expression to directly alter molecular subtype using two methods developed for this purpose, GSEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Bernardo1">[30]</xref> and expression signature analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Lim1">[15]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g007">Figure 7</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g007">Figure 7A</xref> shows a cytoscape network of gene sets distinguishing molecular subtype, which combines data from forced expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> in MCF7 luminal breast cancer cells (node center) with data from knockdown of ELF5 in HCC1937 basal breast cancer cells (outer node ring). This is a sub network of the complete cytoscape network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s016">Figure S16</xref>) and the T47D-HCC1937 sub network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s017">Figure S17</xref>) is almost identical. The gene sets clustered into four groups distinguishing luminal subtype, basal subtype, estrogen responsiveness, and the mesenchymal phenotype. ELF5 suppressed the mesenchymal phenotype in both luminal and basal cells, representing a subtype-independent action. In luminal cells forced <italic>ELF5</italic> expression suppressed the luminal subtype and estrogen-responsive phenotype. In basal cells knockdown of <italic>ELF5</italic> expression suppressed the basal subtype, illustrating subtype-specific actions of ELF5. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g007">Figure 7B</xref> shows the expression signature analysis. In HCC1937 cells knockdown of ELF5 produced a very significant shift in molecular subtype away from the basal subtype toward the claudin-low and normal-like subtypes, consistent with the enrichment of the mesenchymal phenotype observed by GSEA and the suppression of patterns of basal gene expression. In both luminal cell lines a shift away from the luminal subtype was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g007">Figure 7C and 7D</xref>), consistent with the GSEA results.

The 164-gene ELF5 transcriptional signature used to classify subtype in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6</xref> showed a response in TAMR cells (22 genes significantly suppressed, 24 significantly induced) and FASR cells (34 genes significantly suppressed, 46 significantly induced). qPCR confirmed the elevation of <italic>ELF5</italic> mRNA in TAMR and FASR cells compared to the parental MCF7 (MCF7C) and MCF7 from the Garvan Institute (MCF7G) used elsewhere in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). When we intersected the genes from the antiestrogen sets enriched in the expression data in response to forced <italic>ELF5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) with ELF5 ChIP targets, and asked using Oncomine what drug treatments produced similar profiles, we found a predominance of signatures resembling those resulting from inhibition of EGFR (a key pathway driving Tamoxifen resistance in TAMRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Knowlden1">[31]</xref>) among overexpressed genes, and signatures indicative of the IGFR1 pathway and other kinases, or mitosis-disrupting agents, among under expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Both these pathways have been implicated in the development of resistance to antiestrogens. Treatment with estrogen greatly reduced <italic>ELF5</italic> expression in MCF7C cells and this effect was blunted in the TAMR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Knockdown of ELF5 in TAMR cells completely stopped cell accumulation while in the parental MCF7C little effect on the rate of increase in cell number was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). ELF5 IHC on TAMR cell pellets confirmed the knockdown. Measurements of S-phase showed that 25% of TAMR cells and 42% of MCF7C cells were in S-phase of the cell cycle during log-phase growth, consistent with the known characteristics of these lines. Knockdown of ELF5 reduced TAMR S-phase by 28%, and MCF7C S-phase by 12% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g008">Figure 8F</xref>), consistent with the observed effects on cell number.

        <p>Taken together, the results in this study show that ELF5 is involved in the proliferation of breast cancer cells in culture, that ELF5 suppressed the estrogen-responsive phenotype in luminal breast cancer cells, and induced aspects of the basal phenotype in basal breast cancer cells. In both subtypes ELF5 suppressed the mesenchymal phenotype. ELF5 specified patterns of gene expression that distinguished the breast cancer subtypes. Significantly for clinical management of breast cancer, elevation of ELF5 is a mechanism by which MCF7 cells can become insensitive to antiestrogen treatment.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this report we show that ELF5 exerts wide transcriptional effects with functional outcomes on cell proliferation, adhesion, the molecular determinants of breast cancer subtype and phenotype, and acquired resistance to Tamoxifen. These outcomes are aspects of a general specification of an estrogen-insensitive cell fate exerted through modulation of ER, FOXA1, and other transcriptional regulators in luminal cells, and the induction of basal characteristics in basal cells.</p>
      <p>Two key factors in determining the luminal phenotype are FOXA1 and ER. Recent findings show that ER-chromatin binding and the resulting transcriptional response to estrogens are dependent on FOXA1 expression and its action as a pioneer factor for chromatin-ER binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Hurtado1">[3]</xref>. We show that forced expression of <italic>ELF5</italic> in the luminal context directly represses FOXA1 expression and transcriptional activity. We also show that ER expression falls, as does the expression of many estrogen-responsive genes and ER-driven transcription. This mechanism allows ELF5 to suppress key aspects of the luminal phenotype, demonstrated by GSEA and by expression signature analysis. The resulting loss of proliferation is likely to result from multiple mechanisms. Although the proliferation of MCF7 and T47D cells is stimulated by estrogen-driven signaling and transcription, the loss of ER signaling was not the sole cause of proliferative arrest as forced ER re-expression did not effect a rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Rather, ELF5 may act directly to regulate genes controlling cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s014">Figure S14</xref>). In addition the loss of beta1-integrin was observed. Beta1-integrin acts in mammary cells via FAK and src to induce p21 and cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Naylor1">[33]</xref>, a mechanism that is also apparent in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g005">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s013">S13C</xref>). There are additional large changes in the expression of many other key signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001461.s004">S4</xref>) that may also act to suppress proliferation, including EGFR and IGFR signaling. Finally the changes in metabolic activity, including protein and RNA synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation are also likely to impinge on cell proliferation.</p>
      <p>Loss of ELF5 expression in the basal subtype HCC1937 cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, loss of basal patterns of gene expression, and a shift toward the mesenchymal phenotype, demonstrated by the GSEA results and the expression signature analysis. These results show that ELF5 specifies key characteristics of the basal phenotype, but also prevents the expression of the mesenchymal phenotype, as it does in the luminal context. Thus we can discern both subtype-dependent and -independent effects of ELF5. The subtype-dependent effects are a likely product of the differentiation state of the cell and the fate decisions made during differentiation produced by interactions of the ELF5 regulatory transcriptional network with other transcriptional regulatory networks present in the cell, while the independent effects are likely to result from direct transcriptional actions that lack these interactions and are thus subtype independent.</p>
      <p>We propose that the effects of ELF5 in the breast cancer cell lines represent a carry over of the normal developmental role of ELF5 into breast cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001461-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). The primary developmental target for ELF5 is the mammary progenitor cell population (P), produced from the stem cell population (S), and which exhibits aspects of the two cell lineages that it produces (drawn as P cell overlaps). Under the dominant influence of ELF5 a progenitor cell differentiates to become an ER− cell, and with further differentiation and hormonal stimulation ultimately produces a mature (M) alveolar cell capable of large-scale milk synthesis. By this process ELF5 establishes the secretory cell lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Oakes1">[12]</xref>. It is likely that under a dominant estrogen influence the same progenitor cell differentiates to become an ER+ cell with different functions, such as regulation of the stem and progenitor hierarchy by paracrine influence. Recent findings support this mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Bernardo1">[30]</xref>. It is likely that ELF5 and FOXA1 provide the key to the decision made by the progenitor cell. We hypothesize that the outcome of competing estrogen and ELF5 actions on a precancerous instance of the progenitor cell may play a significant role in determining the subtype of breast cancer that results. Additional events may occur subsequent to this decision that alter ELF5 expression and these may be involved in aspects of tumor progression, such as the acquisition of insensitivity to antiestrogens when ELF5 expression increases in the context of luminal breast cancer, or the acquisition of the mesenchymal phenotype when ELF5 expression is lost in basal breast cancer. Some tumors, such as the claudin low subtype, may be innately mesenchymal, as a result of the oncogenic transformation of late stem or early progenitor cells that do not yet express ELF5 or FOXA1 and ER. ELF5 may act to specify epithelial characteristics during the normal differentiation of the stem cell to become a progenitor cell. In this context forced ectopic expression of ELF5 may reduce the mesenchymal nature of the claudin low subtype.</p>
      <p>We have observed that progestin-induced inhibition of T47D cell proliferation is accompanied by an increase in ELF5 expression, and that this in turn acts to oppose the inhibitory action of progestins on cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001461-Hilton1">[34]</xref>. A similar effect may protect some cells from complete growth inhibition by Tamoxifen, and prime them for later ELF5-driven escape of antiestrogen therapy. Further increases in ELF5 expression provide both an alternate source of proliferative signals and further suppression of sensitivity to ER-mediated signals, producing a mechanism allowing TAMR cells to escape TAM-induced growth inhibition. In this scenario the ELF5 ChIP target c-MYC may provide the proliferative drive. These experiments shed new light on the process of acquired resistance to antiestrogens, implicating ELF5 as a potential therapeutic target in antiestrogen-resistant disease and providing a potential marker predicting the failure of antiestrogen therapy.</p>
      <p>Overall we show that the transcriptional activity of ELF5 suppresses estrogen action in luminal breast cancer, enhances expression of the basal phenotype, specifies patterns of gene expression distinguishing molecular subtype, and exerts a proliferative influence that can be modified to allow luminal breast cancer to become resistant to antiestrogen treatment.</p>

          <p><bold>The ELF5 transcriptional signature correctly distinguishes breast cancer subtype.</bold> An ELF5 transcriptional signature was defined as ELF5 ChIP targets with robust changes in expression in response to forced ELF5 expression in T47D cells. It was used to predict ER status (A) or breast cancer subtype (B) in the Reyal series. Rows of the confusion matrix show percent correct subtype prediction at the shaded cells and the distribution of confused predictions by subtype across the row. (C) Ability of this ELF5 transcriptional signature to predict breast cancer subtype and clinical characteristics in the NKI295 series. The 55 Elf5 gene signature was used to cluster the NKI295 series. Subtypes assigned to this series by its authors are colored as indicated. Heat map shows gene expression levels with enriched gene sets within the major gene clusters listed along side. Bottom panel shows associated clinical correlates with the significance of each colored bar indicated by the text at the right.
