<h1>Quick-start IsItOpenAccess plugin development guide</h1>

<h2 id="aim">Aim:</h2>
<p>Get a working plugin which understands the article page of a particular publisher and gets licensing information - hopefully for all articles by that publisher.</p>

<p>The target publisher has to:<br>
A. provide licensing statements in the HTML (no Javascript/AJAX).<br>
This *must* be on the article's page, i.e. we won't be dealing with site-wide policies. License has to be on the page you get after following a DOI.<br>
B. serve their articles from no more than a few domains. You will be copy/pasting the domains that a publisher supports into your plugin, so this list has to be easy to get.<br>
You can actually use regular expressions to detect supported domains, but this quick-start will not go there. See the <span class="inlinecode">oup</span> plugin for an example.
</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
You need:<br>
1. Python. IIOA is mostly tested on Python 2.7. Older 2.x or newer 3.x may or may not work.<br>
2. nosetests to make sure your plugin works: pip install nosetests
</p>

<p>You don't need to actually run the application in order to develop a plugin. So this guide is not going to talk about setting IIOA up.<br>
If you want to run IIOA itself, follow instructions at: <a href="https://github.com/CottageLabs/IsItOpenAccess">https://github.com/CottageLabs/IsItOpenAccess</a>
</p>

<h2 id="writeplugin">Writing the plugin</h2>
<p>
OK, now do in terminal:
</p>
<pre class="shell">git clone git@github.com:CottageLabs/IsItOpenAccess.git</pre>

<pre class="shell">
cd IsItOpenAccess/isitopenaccess/plugins
cp example_basic_string_matcher.py new_plugin.py
# change new_plugin.py to a suitable filename
vim new_plugin.py # or your favourite editor
</pre>

<p>
Now look for <pre>~~ TUTORIAL: YOU NEED TO MODIFY THIS ~~ in the file.</pre>
This marker is above each line or section that you will have to edit.
</p>

<p>
1. Change the docstring at the very start of the file to reflect the aims of your plugin:
<pre class="python">"""This plugin handles BioMedCentral articles. [...]"""</pre>
</p>

<p>
2. Put your publisher's supported domains in this list of quoted strings separated by commas.
<pre class="python">base_urls = ["www.biomedcentral.com"]</pre>
</p>

<p>3. Modify the docstring of this function to point out which publisher your plugin supports.
<pre class="python">def page_license(record)</pre>
</p>

<p>4. This is the actual meat of the plugin - the licensing statements to look for on your chosen publisher's pages.
<pre class="python">lic_statements</pre>
It is a list of mappings. Each maps a statement string to a meaning object.<br>
Modify the example mapping provided. <strong>It is discussed line-by-line here.</strong>
<pre class="python">{</pre>
<p>Find and get a license statement from one of the article pages. Make sure this is the page that you get after following a DOI!<br>
<span id="extrahelp">(In order to be sure, find the DOI of the article on the page you've opened, and type <span class="inlinecode">http://dx.doi.org/<put DOI here></span> in your browser.)</span>
</p>
<p>
Replace this statement
<div class="quote">"This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (<a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0'>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0</a>), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited."<strong>:</strong></div>
with the one you found.
</p>

<p>
Now modify the meaning object
<pre class="python">{</pre>
<p>
The type field is a short unique identifier for the license. The example is Creative Commons Attribution.<br>
If yours is different, open <span class="inlinecode">isitopenaccess/licenses.py</span> and try to look for the title of your license (e.g. Open Government, PLoS WHO) and get its type.<br>
If your license isn't present, add it to the bottom of the licenses.py file and fill in as many fields as you can (canonical URL of license, title, etc.).
<pre class="python">
'type': 'cc-by',
</pre>

The licenses module usually contains more general descriptions of licenses, not particular versions, so use the version attribute to denote something like Creative Commons Attribution v.2.0.<br>
<span class="extrahelp">It's just a string. You can leave it blank if not applicable.</span>
<pre class="python">
'version':'2.0',
</pre>
Is the license open access? This is your judgement call.<br>
<span class="extrahelp">See if the license terms conform to the opendefinition.org of "Openness". If you really aren't sure, ask on the okfn-discuss mailing list of the Open Knowledge Foundation. We do usually set this to True even if there are non-commercial or other restrictions which wouldn't fit into the Open Definition since the articles can at least. Perhaps we should not be doing this, however!</span>
<pre class="python">
'open_access': True,
</pre>
Does the license require attribution?
<pre class="python">
'BY': True,
</pre>
Does the license have non-commercial restrictions?
<pre class="python">
'NC': False,
</pre>
Does the license require that derivative works be licensed under the same or similar license?
<pre class="python">
'SA': False,
</pre>
Does the license forbid derivative works?
<pre class="python">
'ND': False,
</pre>
If you wish to override the URL provided by the licenses module for this license, do so here.<br>
<span class="extrahelp">You should probably do this if the license statement on the page points to a particular URL which is supposed to contain the license terms.</span><br>
<span class="extrahelp">Note you can override any value defined in the licenses module, even the title of the license. For such drastic changes, just create a new record in the licenses module instead of overriding important attributes - it's there for convenience.</span>
<pre class="python">'url': 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0'
}</pre>
</p>

<p>
That's it, you're done with the plugin.
</p>

<h2>Something that is untested is broken.</h2>
<p>
Now, you need a test.

<pre class="shell">
cd IsItOpenAccess/isitopenaccess/tests
cp test_provider_skeleton.py test_new_plugin.py
# change new_plugin to your plugin's name
vim test_new_plugin.py # or your favourite editor
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The bits that you need to change are at the top of the file.<br>
1. We'll start with URL-s your plugin should say it can support.
<pre class="python">SUPPORTED_URLS = ["http://www.plosone.org/1234", "www.plosbiology.org/fakjsskjdaf"]</pre>
<span class="extrahelp">This is a comma-delimited list of quoted strings.<br>
(This is just a URL format test, they don't have to really exist. IIOA users might not always give us correct URL-s!)</span>
</p>
<p>
2. Moving on to URL-s your plugin should say it CANNOT support.
<pre class="python">UNSUPPORTED_URLS = ["http://www.biomedcentral.com/", "askjdfsakjdhfsa"]</pre>
<span class="extrahelp">This is a comma-delimited list of quoted strings.</span>
</p>

<p>
3. Download the publisher's article page that you're trying to process to <span class="inlinecode">IsItOpenAccess/isitopenaccess/tests/resources/&lt;local_filename&gt;</span><br>
<span class="extrahelp">You can convert its DOI into a filename, e.g. pbio.1001406.html</span>
</p>
<p>
4. Put the local filename you gave your article into the following variable:
<pre class="python">RESOURCE = "pbio.1001406.html" # change the value</pre>
5. Put the original URL of the publisher's article page into the following variable:
<pre class="python">RESOURCE_ORIG_URL = "http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001406" # change the value</pre>
6. Put the license statement that you used in your plugin into the following variable:
<pre class="python">LICENSE_STATEMENT = "This is an open-access article" # change value</pre>
</p>

<p>
7. Now edit the license comparison object to reflect the values you're expecting your plugin to write into the license object.
For this quickstart guide, make sure the values of the <span class="inlinecode">open_access</span>, <span class="inlinecode">BY</span>, <span class="inlinecode">NC</span>, <span class="inlinecode">SA</span> and <span class="inlinecode">ND</span> fields are the same as in your plugin's <span class="inlinecode">lic_statements</span>.
</p>

<p>
And that's it. Now just:
<pre class="shell">nosetests test_new_plugin.py # change filename to the one you gave it above</pre>
You should see a message telling you 3 tests have run, and ending in a simple "OK".
