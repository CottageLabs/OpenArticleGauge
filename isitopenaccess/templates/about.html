    <div class="hero-unit clearfix">

<p>The OpenArticleGauge service is part of HowOpenIsIt, a suite of tools developed by PLOS, SPARC, and OASPA to make it easier to determine how open journals and journal articles are. The initial development of OAG was funded by PLOS and carried out by a team from CottageLabs [link].</p>

<p>The OpenArticleGauge provides information on how open a specific journal article is. It does this by going to the article itself and looking for licensing information. The service is available as a website, an API, and as source code. For more details on the software architecture and design see the documentation[link].</p>

<p>The further development and hosting of the OAG is supported by PLOS[link to support page].</p>

<p>For information on reading the output of the OAG see the guide[link to guide page].</p>

<p>For information on the legal status of the license information see legal[link to legal].</p>

<p>For how to help out or get involved see the contact page[link to contacts].</p>
